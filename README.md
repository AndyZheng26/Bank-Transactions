## Introduction:
  
Our financial institution wants to leverage banking transaction data to identify patterns, improve customer service, and detect potential fraud. This project transforms raw transaction data into actionable insights to make data-driven decisions. By analyzing transaction patterns, customer behaviors, and payment methods, we will pinpoint areas for improvement in our banking processes.

## Business Task & Objectives: 
  
Key metrics such as transaction patterns, customer demographics, payment types, and financial behavior will be explored to provide a comprehensive understanding of banking operations. Some examples of questions, topics addressed but not limited to:

- Customer segmentation to identify trends in financial behavior.
- What are the key transaction metrics and overall banking performance?
- Which merchant areas are seeing the most traffic? Fraud? Errors?
- How do debt and spending fit into the context of transactions?
- What are the yearly transaction trends and seasonal patterns?
- How do different payment methods (Chip, Online, Swipe) affect transaction volume?


The dataset consists of 5 main tables: Transactions( >1million rows), Users, Cards, Merchants and Fraud; containing bank transaction data spanning from  2010 to 2019.
